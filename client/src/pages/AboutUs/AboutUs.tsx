                The AMS Data Science Club at UBC aims to provide students with
                an opportunity to learn about data science algorithms and
                methodologies by working together to solve difficult problems
                with data. Members are able to learn from mentors, attend
                events, and join a team to build a project or enter data science
                competitions.

                <p>The purposes of this AMS Club are as follows:</p>
                <p>
                  1. Provide students with engaging projects to learn data
                  science skills through application.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Enable and encourage students to find opportunities
                  involving data science outside of the club and/or UBC.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3. Promote learning by hosting and facilitating events for
                  students to explore data science.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Create an environment which allows for students new to data
                  science to learn from experienced students and for experienced
                  students to learn by mentoring.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Data Science Clubâ€™s mission is to provide students with an
