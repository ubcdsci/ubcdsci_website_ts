## ER Diagram
The entity-relationship diagram can be found [here](./ERD.drawio). It shows the physical model of the MongoDB database, using the crow's foot notation for cardinality.

The diagram was created using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). You can use the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) to open and edit it.
